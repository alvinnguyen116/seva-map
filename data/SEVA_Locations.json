	 	"description": "<p>Cambodia's medical infrastructure was destroyed by the country's painful years of genocide and civil war. Today, there are only 43 fully-trained ophthalmologists for the entire country of 14 million. More than 80% of the blindness in Cambodia is either preventable or curable, but the vast majority of Cambodians do not have access to quality, affordable eye care. Seva works in three northwestern provinces to bring essential eye care services to Cambodia's most vulnerable populations, including rural communities, women and children.<p> Seva's programs serve to build the local capacity to deliver high quality, sustainable eye care. By equipping our partners with the tools they need to provide quality, efficient care, Seva builds locally-run eye care programs that are self-sustaining within 5-10 years of establishment. Seva's proven model of sustainable development is based on a simple formula: roughly one-third of patients subsidize the cost of the two-thirds who cannot afford eye care services.</p>"
